# Nyaa Pantsu [![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/renyaa/nyaapantsu/branches/master/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/renyaa/nyaapantsu)

Think of this as a public library for all things VN and anime related. It is a digital library that is open to everyone, forever; it is a historical artifact, and is a gift each generation imparts to the next.

## Requirements:
Webserver with PHP and SQLITE support (e.g. [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html))

## Installation
1. Download project files (Clone or download > zip) and unzip them to htdocs for XAMPP
2. Obtain a copy of ```nyaa-db``` dump.
3. Start the server (xampp-manager) and find the website at [http://localhost:80/](http://localhost:80/)
4. There you go!

PS. If [http://localhost:80/](http://localhost:80/) does not work try [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

# IMPORTANT
1. Always use Pull Requests(PRs) for updating the code.
2. Ensure at least one other contributor has checked through your code and let them merge it.

# BUGS AND PROBLEMS
1. Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/willi123yao/nyaa-php/issues) section to report problems.
2. Always check if the bug or problem already exists in Issues. If so, please do not create duplicate posts - More posts don't mean faster problem solving.
